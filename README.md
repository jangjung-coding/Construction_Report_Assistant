# 🏗️ Development of a Unified Platform for Real-time Safety Monitoring and Automated Reporting in Construction Environments

## 🌟 Overview

Construction sites are **high-risk environments** where **accident prevention** and **immediate response** are crucial. Safety managers often face challenges due to the manual nature of their work, including hazard detection, response, and report generation. These manual processes can be inefficient and error-prone.

This project aims to address these issues by developing a **unified platform** that combines **AI object detection** and **Large Language Model (LLM)-driven multimodal systems** to enable **real-time monitoring** and **automated reporting**, reducing the workload of safety managers and improving overall site safety.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **🔍 Real-time Monitoring**: AI-powered object detection identifies hazards such as missing PPE or unsafe behaviors on-site.
- **📝 Automated Reporting**: The platform automatically generates detailed reports using LLMs, based on real-time data from the construction site.
- **💻 Streamlit Interface**: A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit enables real-time monitoring and easy access to reports.
- **🔗 GEMINI API Integration**: The GEMINI API enhances multimodal data processing, combining text, images, and sensor data for comprehensive analysis.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Streamlit**: Interactive web interface for real-time monitoring and report access.
- **GEMINI API**: Multimodal data processing for integrating text, images, and sensor data.
- **AI Object Detection**: YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for detecting safety violations in real time.
- **LLM (Large Language Model)**: Powers automated report generation by analyzing multimodal inputs.
